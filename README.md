Find template/shape Itm in greyscale image Is using generalize hough transform

Use generalized hough transform to find Template/shape binary image (given in binary image Itm) in grayscale image (Is grayscale image)

Is is grayscale picture were the template Itm should be found

Itm is bool edge image of the template with edges marked ones

Return the x,y location coordinates which gave the best match

Also return the score of each this point (number of point matching)

%The x,y are the coordinates in image Is in which the the top left edge of image Itm (1,1) should be positioned in order to give the best match
